Feature Fusion Module and Personality Prediction Head

This module implements the feature fusion component and prediction head for personality trait prediction,
building upon the cross-attention mechanism to combine static (face) and dynamic (motion) features.

The module outputs predictions for the OCEAN personality traits:
- Openness
- Conscientiousness 
- Extraversion
- Agreeableness
- Neuroticism
