# Cross-Attention CNN for Personality Trait Prediction

## Project Scope

This research project aims to develop and evaluate a novel cross-attention convolutional neural network architecture for predicting personality traits from short video clips. The system will analyze both static facial features and dynamic motion patterns through a dual-stream architecture with a cross-attention mechanism to predict the Big Five personality traits.
