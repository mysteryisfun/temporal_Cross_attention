# Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Overview

Phase 1 of the Cross-Attention CNN Research project focused on establishing the project infrastructure, including directory structure, logging system, configuration management, and project scope definition. This phase laid the foundation for all subsequent development work.

## Components

### 1. Project Directory Structure

The project follows a structured organization with the following main directories:

- `config/`: Configuration files for logging, data processing, and model architecture
- `data/`: Raw data, processed data, and intermediate outputs
- `docs/`: Project documentation, including phase-specific implementation details
- `models/`: Model architecture implementations
- `scripts/`: Processing scripts and utilities
- `src/`: Core source code for the project
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
- `results/`: Outputs, visualizations, and evaluation metrics
- `logs/`: Log files and experiment tracking data

### 2. Logging System

The logging system provides comprehensive tracking of experiments, metrics, visualizations, and system diagnostics throughout the research process.

#### Key Components

1. **Base Logger**
   - Configurable log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
   - Multiple output handlers (console, file)
   - Structured logging format with timestamps and module info

2. **Experiment Tracking**
   - TensorBoard integration for metric visualization and model graphs
   - Weights & Biases (W&B) integration for experiment comparison
   - Custom database for experiment metadata and results storage

3. **Metrics Logging**
   - Training metrics (loss, accuracy, learning rate)
   - Validation metrics (per-epoch evaluation)
   - Test metrics (final model evaluation)
   - Custom research metrics (per-trait performance)

4. **Visualization Logging**
   - Attention map visualization
   - Feature map logging
   - Training/validation curves
   - Confusion matrices
   - Prediction vs. ground truth comparisons

5. **System Logging**
   - GPU utilization tracking
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Computation time logging
   - I/O operation tracking

#### Configuration Schema

The logging system is configured through YAML files with the following structure:

```yaml
# General logging settings
general:
  log_level: "INFO"  # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  log_format: "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
  log_to_file: true
  log_file_path: "../logs/research.log"
  
# Experiment tracking
experiment_tracking:
  # Weights & Biases configuration
  wandb:
    enabled: true
    project_name: "personality-trait-prediction"
    entity: null  # Username or team name
    log_freq: 10  # Log every N batches
    
  # TensorBoard configuration
  tensorboard:
    enabled: true
    log_dir: "../logs/tensorboard"
    
  # Custom experiment database
  custom_db:
    enabled: true
    db_path: "../logs/experiment_tracker.csv"
```

#### Usage Examples

```python
from utils.logger import ResearchLogger

# Initialize with config file
logger = ResearchLogger(config_path="config/logging_config.yaml", 
                        experiment_name="cross_attention_experiment_1")

# Log training metrics
metrics = {
    "loss": 0.342,
    "accuracy": 0.89,
    "learning_rate": 0.001
}
logger.log_metrics(metrics, step=epoch)

# Log model architecture
logger.log_model_architecture(model)

# Log attention map
logger.log_attention_map(
    name="facial_attention", 
    attention_map=attention_weights,
    original_image=input_image,
    step=epoch
)
```

### 3. Project Scope Definition

The Cross-Attention CNN Research project aims to implement a novel architecture for personality trait prediction from video data. The project scope includes:

#### Research Goals

1. Implement a cross-attention architecture for fusing static and dynamic features from video data
2. Predict Big Five personality traits (OCEAN) from facial expressions and movements
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of cross-attention compared to traditional fusion methods
4. Analyze which facial features and motion patterns contribute to personality trait predictions
5. Create visualizations to interpret model predictions and attention patterns

#### Development Phases

The project is divided into six phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Project Setup and Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
2. **Phase 2**: Data Processing Pipeline (Week 3-4)
3. **Phase 3**: Model Architecture Development (Week 5-7)
4. **Phase 4**: Training System Development (Week 8-9)
5. **Phase 5**: Model Evaluation and Analysis (Week 10-11)
6. **Phase 6**: Documentation and Publication (Week 12)

#### Technical Requirements

1. Implementation in TensorFlow 2.x with Python 3.8+
2. Support for GPU acceleration
3. Modular architecture for component testing and ablation studies
4. Comprehensive logging and experiment tracking
5. Visualization tools for model interpretability

### 4. Development Environment

The project uses a consistent development environment to ensure reproducibility:

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- CUDA and cuDNN for GPU acceleration
- Virtual environment for dependency isolation
- Git for version control
- VSCode for development
