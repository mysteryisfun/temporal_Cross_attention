## Risk Management

### Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Dataset Access Issues**
   - *Risk*: Difficulty accessing or downloading the ChaLearn First Impressions V2 dataset
   - *Mitigation*: Prepare alternative datasets; contact dataset authors early

2. **Computational Resource Limitations**
   - *Risk*: Insufficient GPU resources for training complex models
   - *Mitigation*: Optimize batch size and model complexity; use gradient accumulation

3. **Model Convergence Issues**
   - *Risk*: Cross-attention mechanism fails to learn meaningful representations
   - *Mitigation*: Prepare simpler baseline models; implement detailed monitoring for debugging

4. **Timeline Slippage**
   - *Risk*: Development tasks taking longer than estimated
   - *Mitigation*: Prioritize core components; maintain flexible timeline for non-critical tasks

## Dependencies and Critical Path

The critical path for this project is:
1. Data pipeline implementation
2. Model architecture development
3. Training system implementation
4. Full model training and evaluation

Data preprocessing can begin before the model architecture is complete, but full training depends on both components being operational.

## Weekly Review Schedule

Progress reviews will be conducted at the end of each week to:
- Assess completion of scheduled tasks
- Identify blockers or issues
- Adjust timeline if necessary
- Document learnings and insights
