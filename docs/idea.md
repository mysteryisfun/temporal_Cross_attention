# Video Action Recognition with DINOv2 and 3D CNN Cross-Attention Fusion

## Project Overview

This research project aims to develop a novel, efficient neural network architecture for video action recognition. It builds on the strengths of self-supervised vision transformers and 3D convolutional neural networks to achieve high accuracy and parameter efficiency.

The core innovation involves fusing semantic features learned by the **DINOv2 ViT-S/14** model with motion features extracted by an **I3D 3D CNN** backbone. These two feature streams are integrated using a trainable **cross-attention** mechanism, enabling the network to leverage both rich object semantics and nuanced temporal dynamics.

**Current Status**: Phase 2 Complete âœ… | Phase 3 In Progress ðŸ”„ | Data pipeline fully functional

## Research Problem & Motivation

### Current Limitations in Video Understanding
- **Single-stream approaches** fail to capture both semantic and temporal information effectively
- **Full fine-tuning** of large models is computationally expensive and resource-intensive
- **Traditional fusion methods** (concatenation, element-wise operations) lack sophisticated interaction modeling
- **Limited interpretability** in how semantic and motion features interact

### Our Solution: Dual-Stream Cross-Attention Architecture
We propose a parameter-efficient dual-stream architecture that:
1. Leverages state-of-the-art self-supervised vision transformers for semantic understanding
2. Utilizes proven 3D CNN architectures for temporal motion modeling
3. Introduces trainable cross-attention fusion for sophisticated feature interaction
4. Maintains interpretability through attention weight visualization
