# UPGRADE.MD: GASM-CAST Architecture Implementation Guide

## üéØ Architecture Overview: Graph-Aware Semantic-Motion CAST (GASM-CAST)

### **Current Implementation Status**
‚úÖ **Completed**: Individual feature extraction using DINOv2 (semantic) and I3D (motion) models  
üîÑ **Next Phase**: Implement GASM-CAST fusion architecture for enhanced cross-modal understanding

### **Core Innovation**
GASM-CAST combines three cutting-edge techniques:
1. **Graph Attention Networks** - For intra-modal feature refinement
2. **Bottleneck Cross-Attention (B-CAST)** - For efficient cross-modal fusion  
3. **Progressive Multi-Layer Learning** - For hierarchical understanding

### **Phase 3: Intra-Modal Graph Attention (NEW COMPONENT)**
**Purpose**: Refine features within each modality using structural relationships

**Semantic Graph Attention**:

### **Phase 4: Progressive Cross-Modal Fusion (NEW COMPONENT)**
**Three-Layer B-CAST Architecture** for hierarchical semantic-motion understanding

**Layer 1 - Basic Correspondences**:
- **Input**: Graph-refined semantic + motion features
- **Learning Focus**: "This patch type corresponds to this motion type"
- **Example**: Hand patches ‚Üî Contact motion segments
- **Output**: Lightly cross-enhanced features

**Layer 2 - Pattern Correspondences**:
- **Input**: Layer 1 outputs
- **Learning Focus**: "This object pattern corresponds to this motion pattern"
- **Example**: Object shape ‚Üî Specific motion trajectory
- **Output**: Pattern-aware cross-enhanced features

**Layer 3 - Action Correspondences**:
- **Input**: Layer 2 outputs
- **Learning Focus**: "This semantic context + motion = this action class"
- **Example**: Hand + Object + Push motion = "Pushing something left to right"
- **Output**: Action-aware final features

### **Phase 5: Classification (FINAL COMPONENT)**
- **Input**: Fused semantic-motion features
- **Process**: Global pooling + concatenation + classification head

## üß† Technical Deep Dive

### **Graph Attention Mechanism**
**Spatial Graph (Semantic)**:
- **Connections**: Spatially adjacent patches + semantically similar patches
- **Learning**: Which patches should influence each other during attention
- **Benefit**: Hand patches connect to object patches, background patches form separate clusters

**Temporal Graph (Motion)**:
- **Connections**: Temporally adjacent segments + motion-similar segments  
- **Learning**: Which temporal segments should influence each other
- **Benefit**: Motion sequences with similar patterns become connected

### **Bottleneck Cross-Attention (B-CAST)**
**Innovation**: Instead of direct 768D‚Üî512D attention (computationally expensive)
**Solution**: Compress both to 256D bottleneck space, then perform cross-attention
**Result**: 50% computational reduction while maintaining performance

**Process**:
1. **Compression**: Both modalities ‚Üí 256D bottleneck space
2. **Cross-Attention**: Semantic queries attend to motion keys/values
3. **Information Exchange**: Each modality incorporates insights from the other
4. **Integration**: Add cross-modal information to original features (residual connection)

### **Progressive Learning Strategy**
**Layer 1**: Low-level correspondences (edges ‚Üî motion directions)
**Layer 2**: Mid-level patterns (object shapes ‚Üî motion types)
**Layer 3**: High-level concepts (semantic context + motion = action)
